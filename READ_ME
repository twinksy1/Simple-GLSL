Tutorial 4 - Final

Concludes intro to modern opengl.
Honestly learned a lot about code organization
in opengl with the use of OOP. I think from here
I am planning on moving on to the 3D game engine
tutorial. I think I might make some more directories
in here where I mess around though. Such as a small
game or implementing camera movement.
